# money-exchange-watcher-jsoup-Android
Money exchange watcher is working for watching currency fluctuation.

I used to this url : https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/tr/fiyatlar-ve-oranlar/   FOR getting all values.


This app is an example for using Json library. 

Just download it. And start to use. 

Do not forget to put INTERNET PERMİSSİON to xml file.

İnclueded:

* Json library
* RelativeLayout ( for all multi screen size )
* Custom listview
* Sharing button for sharing with your friends.
* FloatingActionsMenu ( created by library )


Json library used for HTML Parsing. I send the request to URL for getting HTML values. And parse it for getting currency values. Then, I set them to my custom listview.
